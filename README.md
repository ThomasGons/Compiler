## Introduction
\
$\qquad$ How does a compiler work ? An interesting question that I asked myself for a while. That's why I decided to create ex-nihilo my own compiler for C language.

## Description

## Usage
\
$\qquad$ After cloning the repository, all you have to do is ``make`` it. At the moment no option is available so you can just compile your code with ``./bin/exe <file>``. Obviously, the output depends on the compilation phases that are currently being performed by this compiler.
